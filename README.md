This Java program, SudokuSolverGUI, provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for solving Sudoku puzzles. It includes functionalities such as loading a predefined puzzle, solving it using a backtracking algorithm, and clearing the board for a new puzzle. Here's a brief overview of its components:

GUI Layout: The main window (JFrame) consists of a grid of JTextField components for displaying and entering Sudoku numbers. It also includes buttons for loading a puzzle, solving it, and clearing the board.

Data Structures:

board: Represents the Sudoku grid as a 2D array of integers.
rows, cols, subgrids: Arrays of HashSets to track the presence of numbers in rows, columns, and 3x3 subgrids respectively, ensuring each number appears only once in each category.
Functionality:

Loading Puzzle: Loads a predefined Sudoku puzzle into the grid, disabling editing for pre-filled cells.
Solving Puzzle: Uses a recursive backtracking algorithm (solve()) to attempt solving the Sudoku puzzle. Visual updates are delayed to show the solving steps.
Clearing Board: Clears the Sudoku grid, allowing a new puzzle to be loaded.
Validation: Ensures that entered numbers are valid according to Sudoku rules (no repeated numbers in rows, columns, or subgrids).

Concurrency: Solving the puzzle runs on a separate thread (Thread) to prevent the GUI from freezing during computation.

This program utilizes Java Swing for its GUI components and demonstrates a basic implementation of a Sudoku solver with visual feedback for each step of the solving process.
